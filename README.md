# TicTacToe

A Tic Tac Toe game developed in Java. This game uses two bitboards (one for each player) to represent the game state.
All game moves/ operations are carried out using efficient bit manipulation. This method is far more efficient then an OOP representation
due to the much smaller amount of memory/ processing required.
